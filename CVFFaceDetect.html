<h2>Face Detector</h2>
<p>This face detector uses a technique called a cascade classifier to detect faces.  The classifier scans across the entire image looking for face-like features.  It's called a 
'cascade' because each candidate region is run through multiple dectectors, any of which 
can reject it.</p>
<p>Note that this detector was trained with full-face images.  If you tilt your head or show only a profile, the detector will not be able to find your face.</p>
